/**
 * BASICS ABOUT TS...
 * => Typescript is just a superset of JavaScript.
 * => It is like a wrpper over the JS.
 * => Adding strictness over JS.
 * => Like how JAVA is a strictly typed language(which means we should specify the types...)
 * => TS allows us to eliminate mistakes.
 * => Sometimes in JS we used to get the error only at runtime those errors can be avoided by TS.
 * => In simple words we can say TS is JS + strict declaration of TYPES.
 * =>In the end of the day TS will be transpiled to JS only!
 * => TS performs static checking on typing of code itself.
 * => We should install typescript, since it's a kind of tool only most of the time it is installed as dev dependency
